# OMNY Redesigns

The MTA did a (in my opinion) terrible job at designing the OMNY cards so I decided to take a crack at designing them myself.

Designed in Adobe Illustrator and rendered using Adobe Dimension.

I actually originally did this in August of 2022, bu I guess I just forgot about it until now.
